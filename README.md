# TSAnalysisDC
A browser-based time-series analysis tool

## Motivation
Analyzing time-series for insight is a common practice in business intelligence and there are a variety of techniques that allow analysts to quickly understand their data. This tool attempts to accelerate the application of these techniques so that more time is spent looking at data vs manipulating it.

## How to use
The tool contains client-side code ONLY (for now). You should be able to just start a simple http server (i.e. <code> python -m SimpleHTTPServer </code>) and visit index.html through localhost.

There are many outstanding features to be built - let me know if there's anything in particular you need...
